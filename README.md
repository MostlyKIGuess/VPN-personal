# VPN-personal
- Unfortunately the download script doesn't work anymore because they added CAS auth , so download the vpn , keep it in the same folder as the vpn.sh and then run the script :( . 

## New Feature Update:
- I am allowing for credentials to store now so that you don't have to re-enter the creds everytime.
